# About this website

raccoon.bike is a website that shares live stats for Canadian public bikeshare systems. Data is updated every ~20 minutes.

Data is generated by tracking the [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs) feeds of available bikeshare systems. [The tracking software](https://github.com/mjarrett/bikeraccoonAPI) records a trip occuring when a bike is removed from a station or a free floating bike becomes unavailable. For more information about how this works and how well the tracking matches the actual usage statistics, see [this blog post](https://notes.mikejarrett.ca/tracking-bikeshare-use-using-gbfs-feeds/). 

I've also written a Python package [`bikeraccoon`](https://github.com/mjarrett/bikeraccoon) that wraps the tracking API so you can query the tracker with a single line of Python. This website is built on the tracker->API->`bikeraccoon` stack.

If a system isn't showing live data, it's probably because the feed from the bikeshare provider is down. When the feed returns, the page for that system should start working again.
